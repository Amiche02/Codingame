Objectif
Your aim is to take the product of N integers, and output if it can divide by a divisor d perfectly. If it can divide perfectly, output Perfect, otherwise output Imperfect

Perfect division means that there is no remainder when divided by the divisor. Some examples:
21/7 = 3 remainder 0 (perfect)
100/10 = 10 remainder 0 (perfect)
105/10 = 10 remainder 5 (not perfect)

Note: The product will be very large, you have to optimize your code well
